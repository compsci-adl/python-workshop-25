This workshop introduces the fundamentals of Python programming and demonstrates how it can be used across different domains. There are three Jupyter notebooks for this workshop:

1. `python_workshop_examples.ipynb` - Contains examples and demonstrations used during the workshop.
2. `python_workshop_tasks.ipynb` - Contains tasks for people to practice.
3. `python_workshop_solutions.ipynb` - Contains solutions to the tasks.
